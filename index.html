        <p>I am currently a Behavioral Health Coordinator at York Hospital and have been in the Mental health field for
            5 years. I have a Master's Degree in Psychology and I am fluent in Spanish. Being in the mental health field
            has really helped shape the individual that I am will continue to help me in future professional develop.
            Currently at the age of 27, I am in the middle of a career change to become a Web Developer. While these two
            fields are inherently different, there are many skills that I can bring with me from my time in the mental
            health that can benefit me as a Web Developer. I am a very excited to begin my new journey as a Web
            Developer and I am very excited to see where this new journey takes me in life. While I do strive to
            maintain a mentally active life style I also attempt to keep a physically active life style. I enjoy going
            on hikes, bike rides, and going on runs. One of my biggest personal goals is to continue to develop as a
            individual and a professional.</p>
